## About Campari

Campari is designed to be a relatively-thin wrapper around RefreshCS that mostly concerns itself with managed-to-native memory transitions and disposing resources properly. It also serves as a reference for how you might go about wrapping Refresh.

If Campari doesn't do something you want it to do, feel free to file a feature request, but I also encourage you to write your own Refresh wrapper! Refresh was designed to be easily wrappable, so make yourself comfortable.
